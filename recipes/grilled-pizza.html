    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <h3>Making Dough:</h3>
        <li>Pour warm water into a large bowl; 
            dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. 
            Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 
            about 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix in flour, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and salt 
            until dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Turn onto a lightly floured surface. 
            Knead until smooth, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a well-oiled bowl and cover with a damp cloth.</li>
        <li>Set aside to rise until doubled, about 1 hour. 
            Punch down; knead in garlic and basil. 
            Set aside to rise for 1 more hour, or until doubled again.</li>
        <h3>Meanwhile, Making Garlic Oil:</h3>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup olive oil with minced garlic in a microwave-safe cup or bowl. 
            Heat for 30 seconds in the microwave.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</li>
        <h3>Making Pizza:</h3>
        <li>Punch down dough and divide in half. 
            Form each half into an oblong shape 3/8 to 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. 
            Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. 
            When the bottom crust has lightly browned, 
            turn dough over using two spatulas.</li>
        <li>Working quickly, brush garlic oil over crust.</li>
        <li>Top with 1/2 of each of the following: 
            tomato sauce, chopped tomatoes, cheese, basil, 
            and any other topping(s) of your preference.</li>
        <li>Close the lid and cook until cheese melts. 
            Remove from grill and set aside to cool for a few minutes. 
            Repeat with second piece of dough.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
